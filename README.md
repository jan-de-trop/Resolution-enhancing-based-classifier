# Resolution-enhancing-based-classifier

Image datasets can often have poor resolution which can lead to misclassification. To overcome this, the resolution of the images can be upscaled pre-modelling.
To do this, autoencoders can be used. 

## The aim of this project is to:
1) Enhace the resolution of images with autoencoders.
2) Build a classifier for the Stanford Dogs dataset
3) Analyse if the enhancement helped the classifer perform better.
